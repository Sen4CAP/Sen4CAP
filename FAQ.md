# Installation and updates

## How can I update the Sen2-Agri system?

If already have a version of the Sen2-Agri system installed, you can easily upgrade it to a newer version by downloading the new installation package and running the update script. To do so, you should navigate to the installation package directory and start the process:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/Sen2AgriDistribution/install_script
sudo ./update.sh
```

See the [MACCS update section](#how-do-i-install-or-update-maccs) for instructions about updating MACCS.

## How do I install or update `MACCS`?

Starting from version 1.6, MACCS is no longer provided with the Sen2-Agri installation files. You will therefore have to download it from the CNES website and install it prior the Sen2-Agri installation in itself. Steps are also detailed in the Software User Manual (p. 30). Basically, you should:

1. Go to <https://logiciels.cnes.fr/content/maccs?language=en>.
1. Click on the "Télécharger" or "Download" button in the tab with the same name
1. Read the license agreement carefully
1. Fill the form with your information using "Sentinel-2 for Agriculture" as the project name
1. Click on the "I accept the license" checkbox and then on the button that appears. The download should now start.

Once you have downloaded the MACCS installation package, you can follow the installation process detailed in its manual. You can find the MACCS manual in the installation package that you just downloaded. The installation process is summarized here:

```bash
# extract the package
unzip MACCS-site-CNES.zip
tar xf maccs-5.1.5-centos.7.2.1511.x86_64-release-gcc.TGZ.tar
tar xf maccs-cots-4.3.1-rhel.7.2.x86_64-release-gcc.tar

# install its dependencies (COTS)
cd maccs-cots-4.3.1-rhel.7.2.x86_64-release-gcc
sudo ./install-maccs-cots.sh

# install MACCS
cd ..
sudo ./install-maccs-5.1.5-centos.7.2.1511.x86_64-release-gcc.TGZ.sh

# if you your system was previously working with a older MACCS version, you will also have to update the MACCS location in the Sen2-Agri database
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "update config set value = '/opt/maccs/core/5.1/bin/maccs' \
     where key = 'demmaccs.maccs-launcher';"
```

## What is the new sen2agri-services service included in version 1.8?
Starting from version 1.8 a new service was introduced in the Sen2Agri system. The role of the services is:
    * Replace the downloaders implementation. This means that the sen2agri-{sentinel,landsat}-downloader.{service,timer} services are no longer available in the version 1.8.
    * During download, a datasource can be used for querying the list of products and another datasource can be used for actually downloading the products. For example, for S2 the SciHub can be used for querying the list of products and Amazon or a local store like the IPT can be used for downloading or just creating symlinks to the products (for local stores).
    * Provide an API for the GUI for various operations (stop/start downloads, delete site, monitoring etc.)

The configuration of the sen2agri-services can be done via:
* The /usr/share/sen2agri/sen2agri-services/config/sen2agri-services.properties
* Advanced configuration via the "datasource" table in the database.

## How do I stop or restart the Sen2-Agri services?

In some specific scenarios (e.g. when updating MACCS) you might want to temporarily stop the Sen2-Agri services. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop \
    sen2agri-monitor-agent sen2agri-scheduler sen2agri-executor \
    sen2agri-orchestrator sen2agri-http-listener \
    sen2agri-{sentinel,landsat}-downloader.{service,timer} \
    sen2agri-demmaccs.{service,timer} sen2agri-services
```

To restart them you can use a similar command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start \
    sen2agri-monitor-agent sen2agri-scheduler sen2agri-executor \
    sen2agri-orchestrator sen2agri-http-listener \
    sen2agri-{sentinel,landsat}-downloader.{service,timer} \
    sen2agri-demmaccs.{service,timer} sen2agri-services
```

## Should I add the server host name to /etc/hosts?

There is no need to.

## How to set up a reverse proxy?

If you're planning to make the web interface available from outside, it's a good idea to use a reverse proxy like `nginx` instead of directly exposing the server running the Sen2-Agri system. For example, as mentioned in [another section](#does-the-sen2-agri-installer-change-any-system-settings).

For `nginx`, the following (untested) configuration snippet can be used as a starting point:

```nginx
upstream sen2agri {
    server 127.0.0.1:8001 fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name sen2agri.host.domain;
    root /dev/null;

    location / {
            proxy_read_timeout 300;
            proxy_connect_timeout 300;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://sen2agri;
    }
}
```

It expects the site to be accessible from a subdomain, which simplifies the configuration by avoiding the use of rewrite rules. At this point, the web interface currently does not support running in a subdirectory (it expects to be found under `http://sen2agri.example.com/` instead of e.g. `http://example.com/sen2agri`).

Depending on your `nginx` configuration structure, you can either place that in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, or in a new file under `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. In the latter case, you should make a symlink to it under `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

You will also need to edit `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` and change the port `httpd` is listening on (look for the `Listen` directive). The snippet above uses `8001`.

After modifying the `nginx` settings, you can test them and reload the configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo systemctl reload httpd
```

For more information about setting up `nginx` or another reverse proxy, consult its official documentation or your system administrator.

# System status

## How can I check the system status?

To check that the system is running, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# check the downloader status in versions prior to version 1.8
systemctl status sen2agri-{sentinel,landsat}-downloader.{timer,service}

# check the downloader status in versions starting with version 1.8
systemctl status sen2agri-services

# check the L2A processor status
systemctl status sen2agri-demmaccs.{timer,service}

# check the other services
systemctl status \
    sen2agri-executor sen2agri-http-listener sen2agri-monitor-agent \
    sen2agri-scheduler sen2agri-orchestrator
```

For each of the components above you can use `journalctl` to see the last log messages, e.g.:

```bash
# check today's log messages for the Sentinel-2 downloader in versions prior to version 1.8
journalctl -u sen2agri-sentinel-downloader --since today
# check today's log messages for the Sentinel-2 downloader in versions starting with version 1.8
journalctl -u sen2agri-services --since today

# check the last log messages
journalctl -e
```

You can also run `systemctl` without parameters to quickly check whether any service has crashed.

See also the section on [how to check whether the web site is running](#how-can-i-check-that-the-web-site-is-working).

## How can I check that the web site is working?

You can use the following commands:

```bash
# check the web server status
# if running, it will show up as "active (running)"
systemctl status httpd

# check that the web server is listening on the HTTP port
sudo ss -pantl | grep 80

# check that the sen2agri-services are listening on the 8081 port
sudo ss -pantl | grep 8081


# open the site, either by navigating to it in a browser
# or from the command line, like below:
xdg-open http://localhost/
```

# Credentials

## What are the default web site credentials?

The default username and password are `sen2agri` and `sen2agri`. Currently, there is no way to change them from the web interface.

To add users or change a password, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# add an user
# role_id is 1 for administrators and 2 for other users
# site_id is a site id to limit access, or NULL
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "select sp_adduser('login', 'email', 'password', role_id :: smallint, site_id);"

# change the password
# first find out the user id
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c 'select id, login from "user";'
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "select \"sp_changepassword\"(
                user_id :: smallint,
                'old password',
                'new password');"
```

## What are the PostgreSQL database credentials?

The database connection settings can be found in `/etc/sen2agri/sen2agri.conf`.

# Administration

## How can I pause, resume or delete a running job?

If you want to control a running job, you first need to find out its identifier. For that, you can use the "Monitoring" tab of the web interface. In this context, a job is only created shortly before it starts running. See [the corresponding section](#how-can-i-cancel-a-scheduled-jobtask) for cancelling a scheduled task.

Once you have the `id`, you can use the `job_operations.py` script to cancel it:

```bash
# display the usage information
python job_operations.py -h

python job_operations.py -j JOB_ID -o cancel
python job_operations.py -j JOB_ID -o delete
```

The difference between the two operations is that `cancel` is supposed to stop the job execution, while `delete` will remove its tracking information from the system.

You might also want to pause a running job. In this case, use the `pause` operation. To start the job again, use the `resume` operation.

```bash
python job_operations.py -j JOB_ID -o pause
python job_operations.py -j JOB_ID -o resume
```

Note that the job cancellation, pause and resume functionality is experimental and might not work properly.

Starting from version 1.8 these operations are also available from the Sen2Agri GUI, from the System Overview tab.

## How can I cancel a scheduled job/task?

Prior to version 1.8, this operation was not available in the web interface. You will need to remove the scheduled task directly from the database, like below:

```bash
# first find out the scheduled task id
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "select scheduled_task.id, site.name, scheduled_task.name \
     from scheduled_task \
     inner join site \
         on site.id = site_id;"

# then delete it, don't forget to replace [ID] below
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "delete \
     from scheduled_task \
     where id = [ID]"
```
Starting with the version 1.8, this operation can be done from the Sen2Agri GUI, in the Dashboard tab.

## Is there a way to import existing products into the database?

If you have L2A or higher-level products from a different Sen2-Agri installation, you can import them into the database using the `insert_l2a_product_to_db.py` script. You will be able to associate them to an existing site. Note that the script name is misleading, as it should also work for products of a different level.

You can either import a single product or multiple ones. To import every product in a directory, you should add `-m True` in the command line. Otherwise, the path must point to a single product, as the default is `-m False`.

There is no filtering functionality available. For that you will need to either move them to another location, or run the script in the single product mode on each of them. An example is provided below.

```bash
# display the usage information
insert_l2a_product_to_db.py -h

# import one L2A product to the Sudan site
# use the short name from the web interface
insert_l2a_product_to_db.py -s sudan -p l2a -t l2a -d product_path

# import multiple L2As to the France site
insert_l2a_product_to_db.py -m True -s france -p l2a -t l2a \
    -d /mnt/old_products/france/l2a

# import only the Landsat 8 products; their names start with LC8_
for p in /path/to/l2a/LC8_*; do
    insert_l2a_product_to_db.py -s mali -p l2a -t l2a -d ${p}
done
```

Note that this method doesn't insert the products to the `downloader_history` table. This means that, if the downloaders are enabled, the existing products might be downloaded again. The following SQL statement copies entries from the `product` table to `downloader_history`. It might be useful in these situations.

```sql
truncate table downloader_history;

insert
into downloader_history(
    site_id,
    satellite_id,
    product_name ,
    full_path,
    created_timestamp,
    status_id,
    no_of_retries,
    product_date,
    orbit_id
)
select site_id,
       satellite_id,
       replace(replace(name, 'MSIL2A', 'MSIL1C'), '_L2A', ''),
       full_path,
       inserted_timestamp,
       5,
       1,
       created_timestamp,
       orbit_id
from product
where product_type_id  = 1;
```

You should stop the downloader before running it; otherwise it might re-download the products.

Note, however, that this only works for old-style `L8` products. For the new naming convention (e.g. `LC08_L1TP_171058_20161011_20170320_01_T1`), the `L2A` string needs to be replaced with either `L1TP`, `L1GS` or `L1GT`. Since there is no way to undo the transformation, the only approach that works would be to insert all three.

## How can I delete a site?

Prior to versio 1.8, the web interface didn't allow the user to delete a site. If you want to remove a site, you can use the `delete_site.py` script.

```bash
# display the usage information
delete_site.py -h

# delete the "Belgium" site, but keep its products
# use the short name from the web interface
delete_site.py -s belgium

# delete the "Test Site" site, together with the corresponding products
delete_site.py -s test_site -d false -e false -a false -l false -m false -t false
```

You can find the short name of the site in the web interface or by looking at the path of its products. Generally, the short name is generated by converting the site name to lower case and replacing spaces with underscores.

Starting with version 1.8, a site can be deleted from its edit page.

## How can I change the footprint of a site?

To change a site's footprint, you can update the `geog` column of the site's `site` table entry. The footprint is stored as an `EPSG:4326` `MULTIPOLYGON` feature.

```sql
update site
set geog = ST_GeogFromText('MULTIPOLYGON(...)')
where id = ...
```

If you are using the tile filtering feature, you should also update the filter lists in the `site_tiles` table.

The downloader should pick the new site definition on the next run.

## Is there a way to exclude some tiles from the download?

The Sen2-Agri system supports defining a list of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 tiles for each site. This is useful because the uploaded shapefile might overlap the edges of tiles outside the area of interest.

This functionality is not exposed in the web site. To use it, you must first add the site normally, but leave it disabled on creation. You still need to set the season dates and use a suitable shapefile.

After the site is create, you can use the `filter_site_download_tiles.py` script to select the desired tiles.

```bash
# display the usage information
filter_site_download_tiles.py -h

# disable Landsat 8 for a specific site
filter_site_download_tiles.py -t 2 -s test_czech -e false

# choose specific Sentinel-2 tiles
filter_site_download_tiles.py -t 1 -s test_czech -e true -l "33UVR, 33UWR"
```

After running the script you can enable the site in the web interface.

## Can I move or store the files on a network drive?

The L2A processor uses symbolic links to reduce disk space usage when running `MACCS`. This means that the temporary location (`/mnt/archive/demmaccs_tmp`) needs to support that feature. Major file systems that don't support symlinks directly are VirtualBox Shared Folders and `SMB/CIFS`. See [this question](#how-can-i-use-a-shared-or-network-location-for-the-temporary-files-of-maccs) for suggestions for handling those.

The paths can be changed in the database, but if you want to store the files somewhere else, like on a larger drive or network volume, it's probably simpler to either mount the drive to `/mnt/archive`, or replace those with symlinks:

```bash
sudo mv /mnt/archive /mnt/archive_old
sudo ln -s /mnt/large_disk/sen2agri /mnt/archive
```

If you forgot to do this when installing the system, you should [stop the services](#how-do-i-stop-or-restart-the-sen2-agri-services), replace or re-mount the directories and start the system back up after copying the data.

If you are using `SMB` (`CIFS` or Windows-like) shares and encounter permission issues while writing to them, you can use something like `file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,noperm` as mount options, which will make the files world-writable. To improve performance, you can add `vers=2.1,cache=loose`. See the `mount.cifs` `man` page for more details.

## How can I use a shared or network location for the temporary files of `MACCS`?

A file system supporting symbolic links is required at this time for MACCS, but some workarounds are available.

If you are using VirtualBox you can enable symlink support by running

```bash
VBoxManage setextradata VM VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/share 1
```

You need to stop and restart the virtual machine after changing this setting; see the VirtualBox manual for more information. On older versions of Windows, you might also need to run VirtualBox with administrator privileges. Please note that performance might be poor when running the system in a virtual machine.

If you are using `SMB/CIFS` shares, symlinks can be emulated by storing the metadata in a special file. To enable that, you need to use the `mfsymlinks` mount option; see the `mount.cifs` `man` page for more information.

## Can I disable the Landsat 8 download?

For versions prior to 1.8, if, for some reason you want to disable the Landsat 8 download for all sites, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop sen2agri-landsat-downloader.{service,timer}
sudo systemctl disable sen2agri-landsat-downloader.timer
```

To re-enable it back again, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl start sen2agri-landsat-downloader.{service,timer}
sudo systemctl enable sen2agri-landsat-downloader.timer
```

[You can also disable the Landsat 8 download for specific sites.](#is-there-a-way-to-exclude-some-tiles-from-the-download)

In version 1.8 the L8 download can be disabled from the Edit page of a site.

## How can I use products from a local `L1C` store like the IPT Cloud platform?

Starting with version 1.8, the download is done by the sen2agri-services. In order to configure the services to use local store the following operations should be done:

1. Edit the file /usr/share/sen2agri/sen2agri-services/ in order to add/change the following lines:
    ```
    AWSDataSource.Sentinel2.local_archive_path=/eodata/Sentinel-2/MSI/L1C
    AWSDataSource.Sentinel2.fetch_mode=4
    ```
1. Restart the sen2agri-services service using:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart sen2agri-services
    ```

# Other questions

## Why does the system download products outside the growing season?

You might notice that the system starts downloading products three months before the defined season start date. This behaviour is intended and the extra data is used to initialize the L2A processor. MACCS uses a multi-temporal atmospheric correction method and the output quality (of both the surface reflectance valus and the cloud, cloud shadow, snow and water masks) improves with longer time series. A period of three months is estimated to have at least two or three cloud-free dates for each pixel over a given site.

These L2A products are removed by the system once they are no longer needed, to conserve disk space. Besides the MACCS initialization, they are not used for the higher level products.

The system will also try to download products for two months after the end of the season. This is needed for products acquired during the growing season, but processed or published late by ESA or USGS. Products acquired after the season end date will not be downloaded.

## What is `SLURM` used for?

`SLURM` is a utility that manages resource allocation and job scheduling on a computer cluster. When running an automated or custom (created from the Sen2-Agri web site) job, the system uses it to invoke the processors.  While the Sen2-Agri system can run on a single machine, `SLURM` allows the processing to span multiple computers.

The Sen2-Agri installer configures `SLURM` for a single-machine cluster, but a system administrator can modify these settings as she finds appropriate. The settings include `QoS` (Quality of Service) options that can be used to prioritize certain job types. By default the group jobs is set at the installation to 1 but it can be changed to greater value in order to allow parallelization of steps in jobs during processors execution with the following command (for LAI, for example, to increase the number of parallel executed steps to 10):
```
    sudo sacctmgr modify qos qoslai set GrpJobs=10
```

Describing the SLURM configuration is out of the scope of this document, but more information is available on the [SLURM web site](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

Note that execution via SLURM is only performed for scheduled and custom jobs.

## What are the databases used for?

The system stores its configuration and state in a PostgreSQL database. `SLURM` does not support PostgreSQL at this time, so a MariaDB installation is also necessary for its job tracking functionality.

## Is there an easy way to access the database?

You can use the `pgAdmin` application to connect to the database. `pgAdmin` is a free and open-source graphical user interface administration tool to manage PostgreSQL databases. To install it, run

```bash
sudo yum install pgadmin3
```

You can then start it from the applications menu or from a terminal, like below:

```bash
pgadmin &
disown
```

Initially, you will need to create a new connection. The host is `localhost` if `pgadmin` is running on the server, or the server name or address otherwise. You should use the default port (`5432`). Use anything for the connection name, `admin` as the user name and the `sen2agri` password. The database is called `sen2agri`.

## How can I edit files?

The base CentOS 7 install has `vi` available. You can install `joe` or `nano`, or `vim` as a friendlier version of `vi`.

# Troubleshooting

## `MACCS` installation fails

If you get an `Error: the MACCS COTS are not installed` error message, the MACCS depedencies were not installed. You should try installing them again.

A common issue is that of pressing `y` at the following prompt:

```text
Ready  (Y/n) ?
```

A lower case `y` will cancel the installation. You should type the upper case letter `Y`.

The `core` package will require some additional dependencies. You can install them with:

```bash
sudo yum install -y libxslt gd
```

## Dependency errors during installation or missing files

On some systems you might encounter errors related to `geos` or `libgdal` during the installation.

One possible cause is that another package (like `GRASS GIS` or `liblas`) is installed and requires different versions of the common dependencies. In that case, we recommend using a clean `CentOS 7` install and not using other GIS software on the same machine.

The other possible reason is that the Sen2-Agri packages need to be re-generated. In that case, you should probably contact us.


## Shapefile uploads don't work

You should check the permissions on the `/mnt/upload` directory. The web server user (commonly `apache`) and the Sen2-Agri system user (`sen2agri-service`) need respectively write, and read access.

The easiest way to provide this is to make it world-writable:

```bash
# check the permissions
ls -ld /mnt/upload

# mark the directory world-writable
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/upload
```

## Large uploads don't work

If you encounter a blank page after uploading a file (e.g. the reference map for a custom `L4A` job), you can check the `PHP` error log in `/var/log/httpd/error_log`.

Most likely, the reason is a configured limit. To increase those, take a look at the `post_max_size` and `upload_max_filesize` settings in `/etc/php.ini`. After changing the configuration file, you must reload it with `systemctl reload httpd`.

## Sentinel-2 downloads fail

The SciHub server (used for searching products) has a request size limit. If the site definition is too complex, its `WKT` representation might be too long. You should try using a simpler polygon.

## The `L4A` and `L4B` processors crash on large sites

The `L4` processors are designed to read the full time series at once, for every Sentinel-2 tile that is processed. Since there can be a relatively large number of products and each of them has multiple files, this means that the processors have to open a lot of files. Unfortunately, Linux systems have very strict (small) limits for the number of open files.

These are the settings that influence this behaviour:

1. System-wide open file limit &mdash; as configured by the `fs.file-max` `sysctl`. This defaults to `13 060 355` in CentOS 7, which should be sufficiently large.

1. Per-user file descriptor limits &mdash; these come in "soft" and "hard" varieties and can be displayed by running `ulimit -n; ulimit -Hn`. The soft limit is applied by default, but processes can raise it up to the value specified by the hard limit. They can be configured in `/etc/security/limits.conf` or by placing a file in `/etc/security/limits.d`. On CentOS 7 the defaults are `1 024` for the soft limit  and `4 096` for the hard one.

1. Per-service file descriptor limit &mdash; as applied by a service manager like `systemd` on CentOS 7. For example, `samba` has a default limit of `16 384` file descriptors. This can be changed by running `systemctl edit smb` and setting the `LimitNOFILE` value in the `Service` section.

1. `SLURM` node daemon file descriptor limit &mdash; similar to the one above, but defaults to `51 200` in `SLURM`.

The first point above should not be a problem for the Sen2-Agri system. The installer mitigates the second point by placing the following file:

```text
*         hard    nofile      500000
*         soft    nofile      500000
```

in `/etc/security/limits.d/50-open-files.conf`.

The third point may apply under specific situations, e.g. when the input products are located on a Samba share. In that case, you should manually configure the server to increase these limits. A sample override file is the following:

```ini
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=500000
```

The `SLURM` limit is configured by a `systemd` override file saved in `/etc/systemd/system/slurmd.service.d/override.conf`, with the following contents:

```ini
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=512000
```

Note that you might have to reboot the system after changing these values.

## Does the Sen2-Agri installer change any system settings?

Yes, the installer:

* switches SELinux to the permissive mode. There is no technical reason for that, but it has proven somewhat problematic in the past. A determined administrator should be able to re-enable it and make sure that everything is working.
* disables the firewall. The main reason for it is that `SLURM` uses dynamic port allocation. The port range can be restricted, but the Sen2-Agri system does not ship with configuration for this.
* increases the open file limits. For more information about this, see [this section](#the-l4a-and-l4b-processors-crash-on-large-sites).
* switches Transparent HugePages to `madvise` mode, effectively disabling them for applications that do not specifically request it. The reason for this is that we noticed `THP` causing a lot of performance problems. This is done by placing the following file under `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d`:

```text
w   /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled -   -   -   -   madvise
```

These settings are reverted after [uninstalling the system](#how-can-i-uninstall-the-sen2-agri-system).

## What other system settings might affect performance?

* on HP hardware with the `HP Dynamic Smart Array` software `RAID` controller we've seen poor disk throughput until we changed the system to the `throughput-performance` mode by running `tuned-adm profile throughput-performance`.

* on a dual-socket system we've seen poor performance caused by the automatic `NUMA` balancing feature. It can be disabled by running `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing`.

There are, of course, other resources that are better suited to discus Linux performance tuning.

## How can I reprocess some `L1` products?

The status of `L1` products is stored in the `downloader_history` table. You can check it with the following command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "select product_name, status_id, status_description \
     from downloader_history \
     inner join downloader_status \
        on downloader_status.id = status_id;"
```

If you want to e.g. reprocess the failed products, you can change their status:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql sen2agri -c \
    "update downloader_history \
     set status_id = 2 -- downloaded
     where status_id = 6; -- processing_failed"
```

## What are the statuses from the `downloader_history` table?

The `status_id` values from the `downloader_history` define the status of processing of an L1C product. The possible statuses are defined in the table `downloader_status` and they are:
- 1 - "downloading" - the L1C product is currently downloading.
- 2 - "downloaded" - the L1C product was succesfully downloaded but not yet processed by MACCS
- 3 - "failed" - the download of the L1C product failed but it will be retried later
- 4 - "aborted" - the download of the L1C product failed for all retries performed (maximum 3 retries). No other retries will be performed on this product.
- 41 - "download_ignored" - the L1C product contains none of the tiles configured for this site (in case tile filtering is used) and will not be processed by MACCS.
- 5 - "processed" - the L1C product was succesfully processed by MACCS and a valid L2A product corresponding to this L1C is present on the disk and in the `product` table.
- 6 - "processing_failed" - the L1C product was successfully downloaded but MACCS failed in processing it (either due to cloud percentage over 90% or due to another error)
- 7 - "processing" - the L1C product was successfully downloaded and MACCS is currently processing it.

## Jobs are not running or `SLURM` does not start

You can check the `SLURM` status with:

```bash
systemctl status slurm{dbd,ctld,d}
```

Each of the three daemons has a log file in `/var/log/slurm`:

```bash
sudo tail /var/log/slurm/slurm{dbd,d,}.log
```

One common issue is `MariaDB` not starting after an improper shutdown or reboot. That's apparent from the log files as follows:

```text
[2018-01-03T16:13:08.725] error: mysql_query failed: 145 Table './mysql/proc' is marked as crashed and should be repaired
```

It can be fixed by running:

```bash
$ sudo mysql -p mysql
MariaDB [(mysql)]> repair table proc;
MariaDB [(mysql)]> \q
$ systemctl restart mariadb slurm{dbd,ctld,d}
```

## How to use the new version of the L3B processor with version 1.8 ?
Starting with version 1.8 a new version of the L3B processor is available. This version is based on the INRA algorithm (S2ToolBox Level 2 products: LAI, FAPAR, FCOVER. Weiss M. et al., 2016) and is creating, beside the LAI and NDVI also the FAPAR and fCover indicators.
The old version is still the by-default on but this new version of the L3B processor can be activated from using the sen2agri-config application and modifying into `1` the key "L3B LAI processor will use INRA algorithm implementation" or alternatively, modify directly the key `processor.l3b.lai.use_inra_version` into the `config` table.
Additionally, the processor can be configured to generate or not the FAPAR and FCover indicators by setting to 0 or 1 the values `L3B LAI processor will produce FAPAR` or `L3B LAI processor will produce fCover` (the keys `processor.l3b.lai.produce_fapar` respectively `processor.l3b.lai.produce_fcover` from the `config` table).
If only certain tiles of a site need to be processed by the LAI, then the `processor.l3b.lai.tiles_filter` can be set accordingly.
This new implementation is creating much faster the products and also consumes less processor.
Nevertheless, pay attention that this version is working only for Sentinel2 products (L8 is not yet supported but it will be in the version 1.9).
